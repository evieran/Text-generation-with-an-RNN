# Text Generation with an RNN

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It uses a dataset of Shakespeare's writings and aims to predict the next character in a given sequence.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of text generation with RNNs.
- Create training examples and targets for text generation.
- Build an RNN model for sequence generation using Keras Subclassing.
- Evaluate the text generated by the model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## How to Use

1. **Download Dataset**: The notebook will automatically download Shakespeare's writings from a predefined URL.
  
2. **Preprocess Data**: Tokenize the text data and prepare it for training.

3. **Build the Model**: Code for constructing the RNN using Keras is provided.

4. **Train the Model**: Execute the training loop.

5. **Generate Text**: Use the trained model to generate text.
